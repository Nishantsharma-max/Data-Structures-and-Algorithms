# ðŸš€ Learning Data Structures and Algorithms with Python ðŸ“š

I am currently enrolled in the **Complete Data Structures and Algorithms in Python Bootcamp** by **Elshad Karimov** on Udemy.  
This comprehensive **40+ hour** course covers **100+ coding interview questions** asked by top tech companies like **Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft**.

## ðŸ“Œ What I'm Learning:
- âœ… **Algorithmic techniques** â€“ Greedy algorithms, binary search, sorting, and dynamic programming.  
- âœ… **Data structures** â€“ Understanding their strengths and weaknesses to optimize performance.  
- âœ… **Sorting algorithms** â€“ Implementing efficient sorting techniques for large datasets.  
- âœ… **Graph and string algorithms** â€“ Solving real-world challenges like shortest path problems and genome assembly.  

I am excited to enhance my problem-solving skills and work towards **acing coding interviews**! ðŸ’»ðŸš€
